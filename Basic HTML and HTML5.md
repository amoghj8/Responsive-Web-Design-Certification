# Notes

- Adding *required* in the input element makes the input type mandatory
- While creating a radio button, enclose the button within a label with a for attribute whose value matches the raio input element's id
- All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.
