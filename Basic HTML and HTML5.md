# Notes

- Adding **required** in the input element makes the input type mandatory
- While creating a radio button, enclose the button within a label with a for attribute whose value matches the raio input element's id
- All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.
- When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and includes entries for the options selected. Inputs of type radio and checkbox report their values from the **value** attribute.
